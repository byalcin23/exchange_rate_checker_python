# Checking Exchange Rates Daiyl With Python

My firs push to git.I Love open source too much and I can't imagine world with out open source. :)
Just helping to community for better ideas.

NOT: The API was free when I first created this repository, but now they have **limited it to 250 requests per month**. I edited and updated the code accordingly. I wish everyone have a good day.

# Requirements
>pip install requests

>pip install json


# Usage
Function has two variable

1) base 
2) to
3) amount

Base = Your base currency.Eg (base=USD to=CAD amount=1   Gives you 1 USD equals how many CAD )
To = Your destination currency.
Amaount = How much unit. E.g (1,2,10 )

# Thanks
Any improvement helps to community.
