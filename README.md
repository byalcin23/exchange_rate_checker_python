# Checking Exchange Rates Daiyl With Python

My firs push to git.I Love open source too much and I can't imagine world with out open source. :)
Just helping to community for better ideas.

NOT: The API was free when I first created this repository, but now they have **limited it to 250 requests per month**. I edited and updated the code accordingly. I wish everyone have a good day.

# Requirements
>pip install requests

>pip install json


# Usage
You have to visit https://exchangeratesapi.io/  and get API key.

Before the start script you have to edit and add  your API key to api_key variable.
>**api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"**


Function has two variable

1) base 
2) to
3) amount

Base = Your base currency.Eg (base=USD to=CAD amount=1   Gives you 1 USD equals how many CAD )
To = Your destination currency.
Amaount = How much unit. E.g (1,2,10 )
